/*
 * Flash-resident, data-driven sprite faces.
 *
 * The engine composites a base portrait and small replaceable patches in
 * painter order:
 *
 *   base -> brows -> eyes -> pupils -> mouth -> overlay
 *
 * This is the classic adventure-game talking-portrait arrangement: only the
 * changing face parts need separate cells. Atlas pixels are palette indices;
 * cells may be raw or PackBits encoded. Rendering writes RGB565 directly into
 * the same 160x120 framebuffer used by the procedural renderers.
 *
 * Atlas data and playback state are caller-owned. The implementation performs
 * no allocation, retains no PCM, and uses integer arithmetic only. The same
 * player renders into any caller-owned RGB565 surface; the legacy 160x120
 * entry points below are only convenience wrappers for CoreS3/WASM callers.
